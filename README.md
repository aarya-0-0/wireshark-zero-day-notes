# wireshark-notes
My first project capturing and analyzing packets using wireshark

#  Wireshark Packet Detection Project

This project simulates vulnerable or suspicious network behavior using Wireshark. The goal is to detect insecure transmissions and analyze potential zero-day-like activities.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `captures/`: Packet capture files (.pcap)
- `screenshots/`: Screenshots of interesting packets
- `notes/`: Analysis, logs, commands

##  Conducted on Kali Linux using Wireshark.

## What I Did as My First Project:
-Capture traffic using wireshark in my home lab setup
- Observe the structure of HTML response

## What I learned 
-How to use capture Filters
-how webpages send data over HTTP
-How GitHub works with kali

## Next Steps
-Capture SSL/TLS traffic
-Analyze certificate information
